# My File Handling Practice Repository

Welcome to my personal file handling practice repository! This project is designed to help me enhance my 
file handling skills using Python. Additionally, I've included a C++ script to explore cross-compatibility 
with Python for file operations.

## Python Script 

### Features:
- Interactive command-line interface for practicing file handling operations.
- Capable of adding, displaying, replacing, and deleting names in the "listOfNames.txt" file.

### Getting Started:
1. Open the Python script in your preferred editor.
2. Run the script in the Python environment.
3. Follow the prompts displayed in the console to practice various file handling operations.
4. Experiment with different functionalities to strengthen your understanding of file handling in Python.

## Cross-Compatibility with C++ Script

As a side function, this repository demonstrates cross-compatibility with a C++ script.
Both scripts operate on the same file ("listOfNames.txt") and provide similar functionalities for 
file handling operations. This aspect allows me to observe how different programming languages 
can interact and manipulate shared files seamlessly.

### Instructions for C++ Script:
1.De-Comment the c++ script
2. Compile the C++ script using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable.
4. Follow the prompts displayed in the console to perform file handling operations.

## Personal Goals and Progress Tracking

I'll use this repository to track my progress in mastering file handling techniques. I aim to:
- Gain a deeper understanding of file I/O operations in Python.
- Explore cross-compatibility between Python and C++ for file handling tasks.
- Practice implementing various file handling functionalities efficiently.

## Contribution Guidelines

Since this repository is for personal practice, I'll be the primary contributor. However, 
I'm open to suggestions and feedback from others who might offer insights or improvements to the scripts.

Happy coding and file handling practice!
